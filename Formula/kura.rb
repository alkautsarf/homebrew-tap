  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Run the kura daemon as a background service so it auto-restarts on every upgrade:
        brew services start kura

      If you currently launch `kura daemon` manually, kill it first:
        pkill -f "kura daemon"

      Once enrolled, every `brew upgrade kura` triggers a daemon restart automatically.
      Logs at #{var}/log/kura.log.

  end

  def post_install
    # If the user has already enrolled the daemon under brew services, force a
    # kill-and-restart via launchctl directly. `brew services restart` from
    # inside post_install was unreliable (kills daemon but new launch fails
    # silently — likely env/sandbox issue with the brew subprocess). launchctl
    # kickstart is the lower-level launchd primitive and works.
